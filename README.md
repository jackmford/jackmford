# Hi there! 👋

I'm a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** with a passion for creating reliable, scalable systems and a focus on automation, resilience, and performance. I thrive on finding creative solutions to complex challenges, ensuring uptime, and enhancing user experience.

## About Me

- **👨‍💻 Work**: Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
- I enjoy:
  - **🏃‍♂️ Running**
  - **📖 Reading**
  - **🎣 Fly Fishing**

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Projects**: Tools, scripts, and small projects aimed at improving infrastructure reliability, automation, and efficiency.
- **Learning**: Documentation and insights from my continuous learning journey, particularly around Python, Golang, and other observability related technologies.
- **Writing**: I try to keep all of my writing in source control, though to be honest I could do a better job.

## Currently Learning

I’m currently exploring Go by working through DSA review but instead of writing in my main language Python, using Go. I'm always attempting to keep up with the ever changing and evolving observability and monitoring technology space as well.

## Let’s Connect!

I enjoy exchanging ideas with like-minded folks in tech and beyond. Feel free to reach out or connect with me here on GitHub or on LinkedIn!

Cheers!
