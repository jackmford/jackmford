👋

I'm a software engineer who enjoys working in high-performing teams and tackling the challenges that come with building reliable, scalable systems.

🖥️ What You'll Find Here

Projects – A mix of tools, scripts, and experiments focused on reliability, automation, and making life easier for engineers.
Learning – Notes, docs, and things I'm figuring out as I go, especially around Python, Golang, and observability.
Writing – I write on two Substacks ([Becoming Reliable](https://becomingreliable.substack.com/) and [Relay](https://www.byrelay.com/)) and try (key word: try) to keep my writing in source control too.

🔍 Currently Into

Brushing up on DSA, diving deeper into system design, and generally leveling up as an SRE.
